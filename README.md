## Hey there, I'm Acel 👋
### 🎓 CS Student at Florida Atlantic University | Aspiring IT Technician

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Fullstack, Cybersecurity, and Intro to AI.
- 🎮 One fun fact about me is that I built my own custom gaming PC and I love learning about hardware.
- 💾 After graduation, I would love to work for a company as a junior desktop technician or helpdesk to gain experience.
- 🖥️ Long-term, I am considering a career in IT or Cybersecurity as sysadmin or SOC analyst. Still thinking about it.

  
- 📂 Here are all my projects! I'm currently working on building a portfolio.
